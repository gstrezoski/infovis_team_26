## Installation

- Install `node`. It should automatically install `npm` as well. Run `node -v` and `npm -v` to check whether the installation has been succesfull.

- Run `sudo npm install -g webpack` to install Webpack, software that manages your local server

- Run `npm install` to correctly install all dependencies

- Run `npm start` to start the server


## Usage

We use AngularJS (another JavaScript library) to set up navigation and to control the browser.
You don't need to know anything about it, it just means that we will wrap the final D3.js code into some AngularJS code to make everything work.
